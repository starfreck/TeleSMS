## 📘 About TeleSMS 

TeleSMS, a robust application built on the Flutter platform, is designed to streamline and secure your communication experience. The inception of this app was driven by a personal necessity to juggle two phone numbers while residing in a foreign country. The frequent travels between my homeland and the country of residence posed a challenge due to the hefty roaming charges and the inconvenience of leaving behind any phone number, which might be crucial for OTP verification or other significant messages. TeleSMS emerged as a solution to this predicament. As long as the user maintains an internet connection and the app is installed on a device with the SIM card in use, all SMS can be seamlessly received on Telegram, eliminating any potential communication issues. This ensures that no matter where you are, your messages are always within reach.

*Note: Please note that this app would require the user to have an active Telegram account.*
